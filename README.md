Ever wondered where all the pip installed modules go to, if that was a no then I got you.  
*Note: This only works for the modules that you have installed on your desktop Previously.*

## What-is-a-module
Before going into the topic let's know what's actually an module is ? 
Module is a normal python file which can be written by anyone and can also be accessed through other program's which reside in your local storage area.  
Module's can be compared to a function i.e reusable code, but on a large scale which includes everything that python can offer.

## pros-and-cons-of-modules
As we all know modules are reusable but also you can view it's source code and use part of it to make your code a little bit more optimized.  
Through modules we can use other program's functions at our ease but when you don't know what part is it actually going to be used  
then use can use below command to import all functions from module  

		from module_name import *

This will be very handy but increases the execution time, so I recommended you to use this only while testing phase.
